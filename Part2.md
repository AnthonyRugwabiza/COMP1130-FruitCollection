# Part 2 of the Assignment

For this part of the assignment you and your team work together to create a fruit salad ordering program. Create a file based on your group name. For example if you are in group C your file will be called `GroupC_FruitSalad.java`.
Write a program that helps a user order a fruit salad based on the fruits that your group members created in the previous assignment. For example lets assume you have a group of 3 and your team has created Apple, Banana, and Orange. 
The interactive application would work like this:


=================================================================
> Welcome to Team C Fruit Salad maker!
> Please enter how many grams of apple your want in your salad:

`150 // user enters this number`

> how much banana would you like in your salad (in grams):

`200 `

> how much oranges would you like? (in grams);

`0 // note the zero`

> Thank you for your order! 
> Your fruit salad is ready. 
> Total weight of your salad is 350g
> Ingredients: Apple, Banana

=================================================================

Notes: 

* Add a private `float` or `double` variable called `weight` or `amount` to each fruit type to keep track of the amount of that fruit
* Make sure to check that amount of fruit is not zero before adding it to the ingredient list
