# COMP1130 FruitCollection Part 3
Part 3 of Fruit collection assignment for COMP1130 Fall 2021

# Objectives
* Learn more about Classes and Objects 
* Practice using loops and conditions
* Practice using `enum` in java
* Practice using Git and GitHub to collaborate on projects
* Practice continouse user input

# Instructions
* Work with your team to mofify your fruit salad program for your group (ex: `GroupC_FruitSalad.java`) to add the following functionalities:
* At the end of each order ask the user if they would like to place another order. Let them make their choice by entering either `Y` or `N` character.
* If the user selects `Y` you would need to start the ordering process from the begining. For this you would need to use an input loop
* If the user selects `N` your will end the program by saying how many fruit salads the user ordered. For example if they order 3 salads program should end by saying something like: `You placed 3 orders. Thakn you!`
* Note: for the `N` condition to work properly you would need to create a count variable in your program to keep track of the number of orders
* Add an option for a topping using an `enum`. There will be 3 different options: `{WHIPPED_CREAME, CHOCHOLATE, LEMON_JUICE}`
* Note: make sure to implement the topping option using `enum` and allow user to select a topping after each order
